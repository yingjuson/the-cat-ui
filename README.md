## Installation

I used **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** to scaffold this React + Typescript project.

To set up the project on your local, clone the project to your machine:
```
  git clone git@github.com:yingjuson/the-cat-ui.git
```

then go into the project folder:
```
  cd the-cat-ui
```

once you're in the project directory, you have to install the NPM package by running:
```
  npm install
```

after that, make sure to create a **.env** file and set the value of **VITE_API_BASE_URI** with the API base URI that you want to connect to. in this case, specifically, set the value to **simple-todo-app/api**. Please refer to this link for the **[API Repository](https://github.com/yingjuson/laravel-simple-todo-api)**

Lastly, run this command to start the app:
```
  npm run dev
```
